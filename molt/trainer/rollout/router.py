"""Real vllm-router in front of the engine servers, + the rollout transport over it.

The router load-balances the engines' OpenAI API (default consistent_hash: ``x-session-id`` affinity
so a rollout's render+generate co-locate on one engine); weight sync bypasses it (NCCL to the engines). Everything the runners generate goes over HTTP through the router via
one client, ``RouterGenerateClient.generate(token_ids, sp, mm) -> (RequestOutput, off_policy_len)``:
token-in / token-out over vLLM's ``/inference/v1/generate`` (VLM images are rendered server-side
first, over ``/v1/chat/completions/render``, for their mm features). Both the StepEnvRunner and the
chat server (``_chat_server``) share it. These custom routes survive the router verbatim, unlike the
OpenAI ``/v1/*`` routes whose token_ids the router schema-strips.

``AgentRunnerActor`` is the rollout driver process running those runners against the router; the
trainer round-robins prompts across a list of them (``--rollout.num_runners``).

    this actor: the daemon thread never gives the GIL back, the actor's MainThread can't finish
    ``Thread.start()``, ``__init__`` never returns, and the actor hangs forever in PENDING_CREATION.
    So it gets its own process (own GIL, blocks freely); the actor just supervises it and reports the
    URL. Weight sync bypasses the router (NCCL straight to the engines).

    Both listen ports are taken from the kernel rather than left at the router's defaults (30000 /
    29000): a router leaked by a killed job keeps those bound, and every later job landing on that
    node then dies at startup — the metrics listener panics first, which kills the whole subprocess.
